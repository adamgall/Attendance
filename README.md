# Attendance

### Simple app that allows users to:

* enter data on a form
* save the contents of the form using Core Data
* see a count of the number of records saved
* export that data as a CSV though email
  * user must have an email address set up in the Mail app on the device
  * app will probably crash if Mail app is not set up

The code here is just a first pass to get it quickly working. Don't consider it production-ready.
